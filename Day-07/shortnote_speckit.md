# Short Note on Spec-Kit Plus

**Spec-Kit Plus** is a Specification-Driven Development with Reusable Intelligence (SDD-RI) framework built on a transformative principle: **capture intelligence, not just deliver code**.

## Core Philosophy

Every project produces two distinct outputs:

- **Working Code (ephemeral)**: The immediate deliverable that solves the problem
- **Reusable Intelligence (permanent)**: Decision reasoning, prompt patterns, and learning artifacts preserved in the project's `history/` directory

## Key Components

### 1. Two Intelligence Architectures

- **Horizontal Intelligence**: Your personal learning that compounds across projects through Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) " Capture the "WHY" behind decisions " and Prompt History Records (PHRs) "Log what prompts work vs. fail" .Artifacts stay in their projects, but YOU internalize the wisdom
- **Vertical Intelligence**: Reusable components you create after successful sessions. 
    -Three types:
     - **Skills**: Structured prompts with Persona + Questions + Principles
    - **Subagents**: Specialized agents for complex autonomous tasks
    - **Tools/MCP Servers** : Custom capabilities for external system connections

### 2. Framework Elements

- **Templates**: Standardized documents for specifications, plans, ADRs( Architectural Decision Records), and PHRs ( Prompt History Records)
- **Slash Commands**: AI orchestration tools (`/sp.specify`, `/sp.clarify`, `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, `/sp.implement`)
- **Directory Structure**: Organized intelligence preservation in `specs/` and `history/` folders

## The Compounding Effect

While ADRs and PHRs stay within their respective projects, your expertise grows exponentially. Project 1 might take 60 hours, but by Project 10, similar work could take a fraction of that time because you've internalized what decisions work and which prompts succeed.

**Spec-Kit Plus** isn't an AI service—it's a methodology that activates your AI tool's reasoning capabilities through structured workflows, ensuring you don't just build features but accumulate wisdom that makes you progressively more effective.
