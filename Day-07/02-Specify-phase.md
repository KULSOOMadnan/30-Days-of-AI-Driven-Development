## 2. ✏️ Specify Phase (`/sp.specify`)

**What it is:** The Specification Phase transforms vague project ideas into clear, measurable requirements that define WHAT you're building (not HOW).

**Key Points:**
- **Pre-Specification Conversation**: Before formalizing, have an informal dialogue with AI to explore requirements, audience, success criteria, and constraints.
- **SMART Criteria**: Success Evaluations must be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (✅ "8+ peer-reviewed sources" vs. ❌ "well-researched").
- **Four-Section Structure**: Intent (what problem, why, audience) → Constraints (limits, format, scope) → Success Evals (measurable criteria) → Non-Goals (explicit out-of-scope).
- **What vs. How Boundary**: Specifications describe outcomes (WHAT), Plans describe process (HOW). If you're writing about steps or tools, you're in planning territory.

**Workflow:**
1. Have pre-specification conversation to clarify intent, audience, success criteria, constraints
2. Run `/sp.specify` with Intent, Constraints, Success Evals, and Non-Goals
3. Review generated specification for completeness and SMART criteria
4. Verify no "HOW" leaked into the "WHAT"

**Example Specification Elements:**
- **Intent**: "3000-5000 word research paper on AI in K-12 education for administrators"
- **Constraints**: "APA format, 8+ peer-reviewed sources, 2-week timeline"
- **Success Evals**: "Reader can explain 3 concrete AI use cases after reading"
- **Non-Goals**: "Not a comprehensive literature review, not a product comparison"
