# My Prompt :
Command : 
generate a 1-paragraph specification for an email validation function.

Requirements:
Must contain “@”
Must contain a valid domain (e.g., .com, .org)
Should return clear error messages


# Gemini CLI Response : 
✦ The email validation function should verify that a given string represents a valid email address, ensuring it contains a single   █
  "@" symbol separating the local part from the domain. The domain must be well-formed, including a top-level domain such as ".com" █
  or ".org", and adhere to standard domain naming conventions. Upon encountering an invalid email format, the function must return  █
  clear and specific error messages indicating the nature of the validation failure.                                                █
